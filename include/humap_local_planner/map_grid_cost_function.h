 * This class provides cost based on a map_grid of a small area of the world.

 * certain cells to distance 0, and then propagating distances around them,
 * filling up the area reachable around them.
 *
 * The approach using grid_maps is used for computational efficiency, allowing to
 * score hundreds of trajectories very quickly.
 *
 * @rayvburn: The original cost function has been modified in terms of searching of a valid cost cell among neighbors
 * of a cell that is marked as "unreachable" (even if it is perfectly reachable, but simply located in an area
 * of higher costs). This issue should be addressed directly in the base_local_planner::MapGrid, but modifying
 * the cell costs in MapGridCostFunction is an easier way to accomplish the same goal.
 *
 * This can be used to favor trajectories which stay on a given path, or which
 * approach a given goal.
